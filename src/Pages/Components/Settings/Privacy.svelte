<p>For the duration of this study, Aiki will be logging the amount of time you spend on websites that
    you add to it as procrastination sites. However, Aiki will only log the time spent (in seconds) on each 
    site, nothing more. Aiki will not know anything about the content of those pages, only name of the root site 
    (ie: Youtube.com, Facebook.com, etc).</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> Aiki would log that you spent 45 seconds on Facebook.com on Tuesday, but absolutely 
    nothing about the content of the Facebook pages you had open. We will later use this data to see if Aiki 
    helped you to procrastinate a little less.</p>

<p>In an effort to increase security, Aiki will save your data by generating a User ID (UID) from your email. 
    Your UID is a unique number the research team will use to identify you. No one but the research team will 
    know which UID links to which identity, rendering your data anonymous to anyone else. Your real identity 
    will never be used or mentioned in any of the following research.</p>
