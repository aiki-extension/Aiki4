<p>For the duration of this study, Aiki will be logging the amount of time you spend on websites that
    you add to it as procrastination sites. However, Aiki will only log the time spent (in seconds) on each 
    site, nothing more. Aiki will not know anything about the content of those pages, only the name of the root site 
    (ie: Youtube.com, Facebook.com, etc).</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> Aiki would log that you spent 45 seconds on Facebook.com on Tuesday, but absolutely 
    nothing about the content of the Facebook pages you had open. We will later use this data to see if Aiki 
    helped you to procrastinate a little less.</p>
